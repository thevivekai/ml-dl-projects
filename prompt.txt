You are an expert **AI/ML developer** and **GitHub repository architect**.  
I have implemented one or more **machine learning algorithms** on different datasets during my AI/ML training.  
Your task is to generate a **complete GitHub-ready project structure** with professional, easy-to-understand documentation.


---

## ðŸ“‚ Project Structure
- `README.md` â†’ Professional introduction of the project:  
  - Overview of algorithms implemented  
  - Datasets used (with description or links)  
  - Installation & setup instructions  
  - How to run the code (examples included)  
  - Example usage/output  
  - Contribution guidelines (with link to CONTRIBUTING.md)  
  - Contact/credits  
  - Add badges (Python version, license, stars placeholder)  

- `LICENSE` â†’ Default: MIT License (editable if I specify another).  

- `requirements.txt` â†’ List of Python dependencies with pinned versions.  

- `.gitignore` â†’ Standard Python + Jupyter Notebook gitignore template.  

- `CONTRIBUTING.md` â†’ Guide for contributors (standards, PR process, contact info).  

- `project_overview.txt` â†’ A plain-language summary of the project (for non-technical readers).  

- `data/` â†’ Folder containing datasets or instructions on how to download them.  

- `src/` â†’ Source code files organized by ML algorithm or module.  

- `notebooks/` â†’ Jupyter notebooks for experiments and demonstrations.  

- `results/` â†’ Output results, plots, and evaluation metrics.  

- `docs/` â†’ Documentation folder containing:  
  - `developer_guide.md` â†’ Technical details, repo structure, and how to extend/modify.  
  - `user_guide.md` â†’ Simple steps for installation, running code, troubleshooting.  
  - `faq.md` â†’ Frequently asked questions with clear answers.

## ðŸ“‘ Additional Requirements
- All files must look **professional, consistent, and polished**.  
- Documentation should use clear headings, bullet points, and code snippets.  
- Code must follow **PEP8 standards** with inline comments.  
- README should be **visually appealing** with badges, sections, and examples.  
- Keep language simple but professional â€” easy for beginners and credible for experts.  

---

## ðŸ“Œ Output
- Show the **final folder layout**.  
- Generate the **full content** of all required files (`README.md`, `LICENSE`, `requirements.txt`, `.gitignore`, `CONTRIBUTING.md`, docs/*.md, project_overview.txt`).  
- Provide everything in a **copy-paste ready format** so I can upload directly to GitHub.

## 🧠 Supervised Learning

This section contains projects where models are trained on labeled data to predict outcomes.

### ➤ Classification

Models designed to predict a discrete class label.

| Project                               | Description                                                                                             | Key Concepts Implemented                  |
| ------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------- |
| **1. Logistic Regression** | A foundational algorithm for binary classification tasks, demonstrated here on the heart disease dataset. | Binary Classification, ROC Curve, Sigmoid |
| **2. Decision Tree** | A non-linear model that partitions the data into subsets to make predictions.                             | Tree-based models, Gini Impurity          |
| **3. Random Forest** | An ensemble method using multiple decision trees to improve prediction accuracy and control over-fitting. | Ensemble Learning, Bagging                |
| **4. Support Vector Machine (SVM)** | A powerful classifier that finds an optimal hyperplane to separate data points into different classes.    | Hyperplanes, Kernels, Margin Maximization |

### ➤ Regression

Models designed to predict a continuous numerical value.
*(This section can be updated as i add regression projects.)*

## ✨ Unsupervised Learning

This section is dedicated to projects where models work with unlabeled data to discover hidden patterns and structures.
*(This section can be updated as i add projects like K-Means Clustering, PCA, etc.)*

## 🛠️ Technologies & Libraries

This project is built using Python 3 and leverages the following core data science libraries:

* **Pandas:** For data manipulation and analysis.
* **NumPy:** For numerical operations.
* **Scikit-learn:** For implementing machine learning models and metrics.
* **Matplotlib / Seaborn:** For data visualization.
* **Jupyter Notebook:** For interactive development and analysis.

## 🚀 How to Use

To explore these projects on your local machine, please follow these steps:

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone [https://github.com/thevivekai/ml-dl-projects.git](https://github.com/thevivekai/ml-dl-projects.git)
    ```

2.  **Navigate to the project directory:**
    ```bash
    cd ml-dl-projects
    ```

3.  **Install the required libraries:**
    It is recommended to use a virtual environment.
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```
    *(Note: You will need to create a `requirements.txt` file for this to work.)*

4.  **Launch Jupyter Notebook:**
    ```bash
    jupyter notebook
    ```
    You can now navigate through the folders and run the `.ipynb` notebooks for each project.
